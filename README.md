Code associated with the SIMAX paper "High curvature means low rank: On the sectional curvature of Grassmann and Stiefel manifolds and the underlying matrix trace inequalities"

This is Matlab code associated with the numerical experiments of Section 4 in the SIMAX paper

HIGH CURVATURE MEANS LOW-RANK: ON THE SECTIONAL CURVATURE OF GRASSMANN AND STIEFEL MANIFOLDS AND THE UNDERLYING MATRIX TRACE INEQUALITIES

by RALF ZIMMERMANN AND JAKOB STOYE

# Guidelines

The numerical results associated with the paper feature in Section 4, which is divided into the Subsections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.

* To reproduce the experimental results of Subsection 4.1, execute the Matlab script
  >> script_curvature_SIMAX_exp41

* To reproduce the experimental results of Subsection 4.2, execute the Matlab script
  >> script_curvature_SIMAX_exp42
	This is a set of random experiments.
	When asked, enter "100" as the number of runs in the random experiment and "1000" as the maximal dimension p to reproduce the results from the paper. Mind that the calculations may take a while.


* To reproduce the experimental results of Subsection 4.3, execute the Matlab script
  >> script_curvature_SIMAX_exp43


More detailed explanation is included in comment sections in the respectives scripts.
